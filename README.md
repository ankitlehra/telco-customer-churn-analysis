# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project aims to analyze telecom customer churn behavior by leveraging Python and MySQL. The project focuses on extracting data from a MySQL database, analyzing it using Python, and visualizing key insights.

## Project Features
- **Data Extraction from MySQL**: The data was extracted using Python's MySQL connector.
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas was used to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create insightful visualizations to understand customer churn behavior.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **MySQL**: Database for customer data storage and SQL querying.
- **Pandas**: Data wrangling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization tools.
  
## Data
The dataset used for this project is `telco_customers.csv`, containing information about customer demographics, service usage, and churn status.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created:
1. **Churn Distribution**
2. **Tenure vs. Churn**
3. **Monthly Charges vs. Churn**
4. **Gender Distribution**
5. **Contract and Payment Methods Analysis**

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MySQL database with the dataset.
3. Use the provided `main.py` script to connect to the MySQL database and perform the analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Further analysis using machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Enhancement of visualizations and interactive dashboards.
